package configs

// File describes the contents of a single configuration file.
//
// Individual files are not usually used alone, but rather combined together
// with other files (conventionally, those in the same directory) to produce
// a *Module, using NewModule.
//
// At the level of an individual file we represent directly the structural
// elements present in the file, without any attempt to detect conflicting
// declarations. A File object can therefore be used for some basic static
// analysis of individual elements, but must be built into a Module to detect
// duplicate declarations.

	Version   int
	Variables []*Variable
	Outputs   []*Output
	Scenarios []*Scenario
